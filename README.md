# solo_project

This was our class solo project. It is a dynamic newsletter for a school based on a seven period day. There is an administration area for adding parents, teachers, classes and students. There is a teacher login that allows teachers to put in updates for their classes, and there is a parent area that allows parents to see a dynamic newsletter for each of their students.

It is built using javascript, node, express and PostgreSQL.
